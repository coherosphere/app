# coherosphere / app

**The coherence dashboard — participate, contribute, and govern through resonance.**  

This repository contains the **user application** of the coherosphere ecosystem:  
a decentralized interface for Proof-of-Contribution, voting, and coherence visualization.

---

## Purpose

The app turns abstract governance and metrics into lived experience.  
It enables every participant to **see, feel, and shape** the field of coherence  
— transforming alignment and contribution into transparent, collective agency.

---

## Features

- **Proof-of-Contribution interface** (submit, verify, and visualize)  
- **Voting & governance module** — sublinear weighting and time-decay logic  
- **Resonance map** — personal and systemic coherence dashboards  
- **Identity layer** — Proof-of-Contribution Identity (PoCI) integration  
- **Cross-hub connection** — local → global participation  

---

## Usage

Built as a **progressive web app (PWA)** using **Next.js, TypeScript, and Web3.js**.  
Connects directly to the coherosphere API and DAO contracts.
